 * regarding when they are instantiated or how often they are called. Since
 * instances may potentially be cached and called from different threads, they
 * should be thread-safe.

 * <p>Extend {@link TypedConversionService} if your implementation always converts
 * from a given source type into a given target type and does not need access to
 * the {@link ClassLoader} to perform the conversion.
